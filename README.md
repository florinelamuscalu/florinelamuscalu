### More about me

  <p>I'm a pretty open-minded person, a fast learner, very ambitious and striving for success in everything that I do.
     I like socializing and meeting new people, even though I may seem a bit shy at first. Some of my hobbies
     include cooking and coding/programming, as I usually like to learn new stuff by myself in order to progress
     further and further. I enjoy working as part of a team, but also single-handedly carrying out tasks in order to challenge myself. </p>
